# Sunofriend architecture

Sunofriend has two user-facing layers:

1. The Python package and `sunofriend` command are the deterministic engine.
2. The portable Agent Skill selects commands, checks prerequisites and
   interprets reports. It must not duplicate audio or MIDI algorithms.

`midi_mask.py` is an experimental Phase 4 boundary, not a generic separator.
It accepts one explicit note-bearing MIDI track, limits work to a short audio
excerpt, and publishes source, harmonic target and waveform-defined residual
as deterministic PCM24. Persisted target-plus-residual reconstruction, hashes
and zero input-mutation effects are part of its report contract; listening and
re-transcription decide whether either derivative is useful.

Instrument matching deliberately has two adapters rather than a private DAW
integration: installed GarageBand/Logic sample assets are profiled directly,
while candidate MIDI programs are rendered through the existing FluidSynth
boundary. The output is an audition shortlist. Stem-derived sample instruments
write cleaned WAV/SFZ assets plus a narrow, self-contained SoundFont 2.01 bank
that Apple's public sampler interface and FluidSynth can load. They never
mutate Apple factory content, private patch files or GarageBand project bundles.

`instrument_usability.py` is the boundary between successful artifact creation
and a usable musical instrument. It tests the generated zones against the
actual selected MIDI track for key/velocity coverage and effective one-shot
duration. A failure demotes the bank to an optional texture layer in Instrument
Bundle v1; it does not modify notes, samples or mappings. Pitch estimates and
timbre clusters remain listening evidence rather than automatic rejection.

`instrument_preference.py` is a deliberately explicit feedback boundary. It
hash-pins one reviewed DAW patch choice to an Instrument Bundle, then builds a
deterministic profile only from paths named by the user. Bundle integration is
additive: it copies the profile and displays a history-first hint while leaving
factory/GM/OpenL3 ranking, defaults, MIDI and the usability gate unchanged.
There is no implicit file discovery, hidden preference database or automatic
patch selection.

The CLI command names, exit codes, JSON reports, Clip v1 schema and generated
MIDI timing contracts are compatibility surfaces. Private helpers beginning
with `_` are implementation details and should not be called by agent skills or
third-party integrations.

## Change rules

- Preserve source audio and existing output by default. Require an explicit
  overwrite option for destructive replacement.
- Characterize MIDI byte/event behaviour before moving parsers. Running status,
  SysEx, tempo maps, controllers, drum channel 10 and pitch bends all matter.
- Keep `exact`, `repair` and `reconstruct` evidence policies distinct.
- Publish uncertainty and provenance rather than silently turning weak evidence
  into main-track notes.
- Keep optional audio, preview and playback dependencies lazy so pure MIDI and
  Clip operations work in a lightweight installation.
- Add a deterministic regression test before changing pitch, timing, note
  count, provenance or output layout.
- Keep instrument discovery read-only. Treat matching weights and report
  fields as evidence contracts, and retain the final patch choice as user
  feedback that can be stored through Clip v1.

## Incremental refactoring map

The safest next boundaries are:

1. Add typed application operations for folder conversion, one-stem conversion,
   vocal extraction and MIDI transformation; keep CLI handlers as adapters.
2. Centralize instrument roles, aliases, channels, GM programs and GarageBand
   suggestions in one immutable registry.
3. Introduce a lossless Standard MIDI File codec and shared batch/path-safety
   utilities, then migrate one command at a time against a common fixture set.
4. Share phase-safe audio loading and an explicit beat-grid to `TempoMap`
   adapter.
5. Split the large Clip and vocal modules only after compatibility re-exports
   and characterization tests exist.

Do not combine those moves into a single rewrite. The existing golden songs
and synthetic tests are the guardrail for each small migration.
